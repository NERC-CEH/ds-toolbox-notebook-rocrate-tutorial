    "Any data science project or workflow always starts with the data itself. This often requires an understanding of the data's structure, the context in which is was collected, any underlying assumptions about the data, licencing information and the provenance of the data. This information is collectively known as metadata and is usually supplied with the data but in often in separate files or documentation. In addition the data itself often comes in multiple files that sometimes need to be downloaded individually and uploaded to separate platfoms in order to perform any analysis. This can provide a challenge to working with the data and lead to large amounts of time spent getting the data ready for analysis. \n",

    " This notebook demonstrates the use of RO-Crate to extract data from the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC), inspect its metadata and then read in the data itself. An RO-Crate is a way of packaging up the entire research object (data, metadata, methods, etc) so that the data and metadata are linked in a coherant context no matter where they are stored. RO-Crate can also be used read in the data directly from source rather than hacing to donwload it manually first. \n",

    "To run the notebook it is advised to first clone the repository housing the notebook ('*git clone https://github.com/NERC-CEH/ds-toolbox-notebook-rocrate-tutorial.git*'). This will create a folder in the current directory called *ds-toolbox-notebook-rocrate-tutorial*, which holds all the relevant files including the notebook, environment file and relevant input data. The next step is to create a conda environment with the right packages installed using the clean yml file ('*conda env create -f environment-clean.yml*'), which creates the *rocrate-tutorial* environment that can be activated using '*conda activate rocrate-tutorial*'. At this point the user can either run code from the notebook in their preferred IDE or via the jupyter interface using the command '*jupyter notebook*'.\n",
